            Its spring in Manhattan and two old friends are meeting
            in the park after a shared late lunch. The sun is just starting to peek over the skyscrapers of downtown and the
            pink, polluted clouds out by JFK way - central way
            across the highways where the cars drive out of Manhattan for the busy airport – and it’s still early. There’s new
            asphalt here, which was just laid on the streets outside Central Park by those strong, older working guys.
            Those last couple of days outside the park is the subject of conversation....
