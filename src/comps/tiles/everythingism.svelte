        <h2>EVERYTHINGISM</h2>

    <p>
        On the overproduction of imagery in contemporary art and architecture. Everythingism, a response to the concept of content based lifestyles, where everything has become tokenized, recorded, made as fast-food, use-and-discard image and video for us to coonsoomÂ´1. A lens with which to perceive the world less dogmatically and logically, but through a filter of a highly defined and personal sense, a system and rule of thought - a list of twelve rules to lay down for yourself when consuming content and choosing what to and what not to indulge.
