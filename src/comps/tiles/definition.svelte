            I was wandering the streets. A hobo in every aspect but for my head. My eyes were too innocent—misleadingly so, I thought—and my mind was too self-conscious. I was too aware of my own authenticity, as I trodded along purposelessly through those quaint little back alleys that the make the city I live. I live in a city of dumpsters, bars and bridges. Others here, I suspect, live in a city of restaurants and lawyers offices; titans of industry I imagine them to be. What frail shoes they wear as they walk past me here! I wear boots.
